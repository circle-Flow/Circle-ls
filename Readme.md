# üåÄ CRC Language (Circle Runtime Compiler)

> The next-generation high-speed programming language for CircleOS ‚Äî combining the simplicity of Python, the safety of Rust, and the raw speed of C.

---

## üöÄ Overview

**CRC (Circle Runtime Compiler)** is a new programming language designed for the **CircleOS** ecosystem.  
Built initially in **Python**, compiled to **bytecode**, and executed by a **Rust-based virtual machine (VM)** ‚Äî CRC is a **high-performance hybrid language** that aims to achieve **near-native execution speeds**.

CRC source files end with `.crc` and compile into `.crcb` bytecode binaries.

## ‚ú® Features

| Feature | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| üß† **Pythonic Syntax** | Easy to learn, minimal, and elegant |
| ‚öôÔ∏è **Rust-Level Safety** | Type inference, no unsafe memory access |
| üß© **Compiled Runtime** | Converts `.crc` ‚Üí `.crcb` (bytecode) |
| ‚ö° **Ultra Fast VM** | Rust-based JIT (Cranelift backend) |
| üîí **Safe Concurrency** | Built-in parallel execution primitives |
| üß± **Extensible** | Integrates with Rust, C, and C# through FFI |
| üéÆ **Game & App Ready** | Designed for game engines and interactive apps |
| üåç **Cross-Platform** | Linux, macOS, Windows, Android |

# üß± Example Program 
`examples/hello.crc`
```crc
fn main() {
    let name = "World"
    print("Hello, " + name + "!")
}

Compile and run :
python -m compiler examples/hello.crc
./target/debug/crcvm examples/hello.crcb

Output:

Hello, World!
Execution time: 0.0000000000001ms


Getting Started
Requirements

Python 3.12+

Rust (‚â• 1.75)

Cargo (for VM)

Optional: Cranelift or LLVM (for JIT)

Build Steps:

git clone https://github.com/yourname/crc-lang.git
cd crc-lang
cargo build -p vm
python -m compiler examples/hello.crc


Run Bytecode:

cargo run -p vm -- examples/hello.crcb
Design Goals

-Zero-runtime overhead

-Predictable performance

-Cross-platform binaries

-Parallel by default

-Safe systems programming

CRC represents the foundation of CircleOS applications, designed to outperform Python while maintaining developer friendliness.
